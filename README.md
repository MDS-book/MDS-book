# MDS-book
This is the main repository for supplementary material (such as Python scripts or figures) for the MDS book.

Content:
- The folder `code` contains jupyter notebooks and Python scripts with all code snippets from the book -- sometimes with a few additional examples.

- The folder `python_listings` contains all Python functions and classes that are listed in the "List of Python Listings" at the end of the MDS book. These are functions that are intended for re-use. Everything else can be found in the folder `code`.
